"# Game review" 
IDEA:
- User can create an account and login to the application
- User can post, delete and edit their posts
    - Includes adding an image, text and a number review
- User is able to see other reviews and navigate between different games
- User is able to see their profile, which includes the reviews they have posted
- Games are categorized
  - User is able to see the mean score and the amount of reviews on a specific game
- Users are able to leave comments on other reviews

State of the website/code:
Main page provides login and a redirect to registration
Code for adding, deleting posts and modifying the review text
Reviews should publish on the correct website
Code for search function which allows to search by name and genre

I currently get an error saying "sqlite3.DatabaseError: file is not a database" when I try to send a registration form. The error probably means that the database.db is corrupted or my sqlite3 cant find the correct path to it. I've tried fixing this for 4 hours with no prevail and I'm giving up.
I have not tested how any of the functions work in action, but almost everything should be following the course material 👍


The code is in branches -> master, I dont know what i did for it to go there, but hopefully that's okay

I wrote the updated README now in master -branch
